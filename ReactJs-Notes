1. Initial setup
  Install node
  Install Visual Studio Code

2. Creating an app 
  2.1 using npx
    npx create-react-app hello-world
    cd hello-world
    npm start
  2.2 using npm
    npm install create-react-app -g
    create-react-app hello-world

3. Control flow
  /public/index.html
  /src/index.js
  /src/App.js

4. Components
  4.1 Functional Components - stateless
    props - optional parameter
    just returns jsx
      use as much as possible
      no need to worry about this keyword
      mainly responsible for UI
  
  4.2 Class Components - stateful
    typical ES6 class
    extends React.Component
    props - optional parameter
    state - optional private state
    render method return jsx
      feature rich
      complex UI logic
      lifecycle hooks

5. JSX - JavaScript XML 
  xml like code for elements and Components
  has tag name, attributes and children

6. Props
  Passed from Parent component (attributes) to child component.
  Functional parameters
  immutable - child component cannot change the props value
  Functional components - props parameter
  Class components - this.props

7. State
  Managed within the component
  Variables are declared in the function body
  Mutable - can be changed
  Functional components - useState Hook
  Class component - this.state

  7.1 setState() in Class components
    React groups multiple setState() calls into one for better performance
    if state has to be set based on previous state, use function as first arg for setState()
